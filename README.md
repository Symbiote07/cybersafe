# CyberSafe: Cybersecurity Incident Reporting and Risk Assessment Application

## Description

CyberSafe is a web application designed to streamline the process of reporting cybersecurity incidents and conducting risk assessments. It provides a user-friendly interface for individuals and organizations to report security breaches, assess their cyber risk posture, and potentially receive automated insights and guidance.

## Features

*   **Incident Reporting:** Allows users to submit detailed reports of cybersecurity incidents.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Provides tools for assessing an organization's cyber risk score based on various factors.
*   **Automated Triage (Potential):** AI-powered initial analysis of reported incidents to categorize and prioritize them.
*   **Evidence Scrubbing (Potential):** Tools to help anonymize or clean sensitive information from incident reports.
*   **Fraud Pattern Detection (Potential):** AI capabilities to identify potential fraudulent activity based on reported data.
*   **Communication Tools (Potential):** Features for communication regarding reported incidents.
*   **Reporting Dashboard (Potential):** A dashboard to view reported incidents and risk assessment results.

## Technologies Used

## Application Flow

The CyberSafe application is designed to guide users through the process of reporting a cybersecurity incident or assessing their cyber risk. Here's a typical user journey:

1.  **Landing Page:** Users arrive at the application's main page (`src/app/page.tsx`). From here, they can choose to either report an incident or start a cyber risk assessment.
2.  **Incident Reporting:**
    *   If the user selects "Report Incident", they are directed to the incident reporting form (`src/app/report-incident/page.tsx`).
    *   The user fills out the form with details about the incident, such as the type of incident, date, time, description, and any relevant evidence.
    *   Upon submission, the report is processed (handled by `src/app/api/reports/route.ts`) and potentially triaged automatically using AI flows (`src/ai/flows/auto-triage.ts`).
    *   The user might receive a confirmation or a report ID to track their submission (`src/app/track-report/page.tsx`).
3.  **Cyber Risk Assessment:**
    *   If the user selects "Cyber Risk Assessment", they are directed to the assessment form (`src/app/cyber-risk-assessment/page.tsx`).
    *   The user answers questions related to their organization's cybersecurity practices, infrastructure, and policies.
    *   The application processes this information (potentially using `src/ai/flows/cyber-risk-score-flow.ts`) to generate a cyber risk score and potentially provide recommendations.
4.  **Tracking Reports and Communication:**
    *   Users who reported an incident can use the tracking feature (`src/app/track-report/page.tsx`) to check the status of their report.
    *   Depending on the implementation, there might be a chat interface (`src/components/chat-interface.tsx`, handled by `src/app/api/chat/[chatId]/messages/route.ts` and potentially `src/lib/chat-store.ts`) for communication related to a specific incident.


*   **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js (or similar)
*   **Database:** (Specify database if used, e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase)
*   **AI/ML:** Genkit, potentially integrating with models like Gemini
*   **Other:** TypeScript
