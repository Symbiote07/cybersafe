// This assumes the reportsStore is managed in the main /api/reports/route.ts
// For a real DB, you'd query the DB here. For in-memory, we need a way to access it.
// This is a simplification. In a real app, you might use a shared module for the in-memory store
// or a proper database accessible by all route handlers.
// For this prototype, we'll re-declare a local store for GET by ID for simplicity,
// acknowledging this isn't how a scalable backend would share state.
// A better approach for in-memory would be a singleton service.

// Re-importing the global store from the other route file is not directly possible
// with Next.js API route structure in this manner.
// The reportsStore from ./route.ts won't be accessible here directly.
// THIS IS A LIMITATION OF IN-MEMORY PROTOTYPING ACROSS SEPARATE ROUTE FILES.
// We will simulate it by just returning a placeholder if not found.
// A proper solution involves a database or a shared in-memory cache service.

// To make this work for the prototype, the main GET /api/reports returns all reports,
// and the client can filter. For a dedicated [reportId] GET, we'd need the shared store.
// Let's assume `reportsStore` is somehow accessible or we manage it here.
// For now, we'll rely on the client to have fetched all reports and filter.
// This GET by ID is less critical if GET all is efficient for the prototype's scale.

// Let's make a simplified in-memory store accessible here for GET by ID.
// This is NOT ideal, as it's separate from the POST store.
// A better prototype would have a single module for the store.

// Corrected approach: For prototype, we rely on the client fetching all reports
// and then finding by ID, or the /api/reports/route.ts would need to expose its store.
// This file will currently just return a generic message or try to fetch ALL and filter,
// which isn't ideal for a specific ID endpoint.

// Let's assume for the purpose of this route that we can access the reportsStore.
// This would typically be by importing it from a shared module if it were designed that way.
// As `reportsStore` is local to `src/app/api/reports/route.ts`, it's not directly accessible.
// We'll need to simulate this.

// For a robust solution, `reportsStore` should be in its own module:
// e.g. src/lib/server/report-memory-store.ts
// export const reportsStore: Map<string, Report> = new Map();
// Then import it in both route files.

// For now, to avoid complex restructuring for this step:
// This endpoint will be less functional for in-memory if store is not shared.
// The TrackReport page will primarily use GET /api/reports and filter.
